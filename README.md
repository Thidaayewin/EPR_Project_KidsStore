Family Toy Shop Digitalization Project

I am trying to spend my free time with C# Dot Net Development skills by digitalising my parent's small business.

To test this E-commerce project, you will need the following requirements...

Dot Net core version 7
MSSQL DB with table, for tables please refer to the model in the code file.
PostMan or Swagger because my app design is based on API.

I will come up with new updated features and code soon.

Thank you for exploring my project
